# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** What are the best React table libraries in 2024 that integrate well with TanStack Query (React Query) and Next.js? I need features like column sorting, global search, filtering, pagination, and good TypeScript support. Compare TanStack Table, React Table, AG Grid, and other modern options.

**Response:**

## Best React Table Libraries in 2024 for TanStack Query & Next.js

Selecting a robust table library for a Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS project that already uses TanStack Query v5 requires careful consideration of **integration flexibility**, **feature set**, and **TypeScript support**. Below is a detailed comparison of the most relevant libraries for your stack and requirements.

---

### 1. **TanStack Table (React Table v8+)**

**Overview:**  
TanStack Table (formerly React Table) is a **headless** table library, meaning it provides only logic and state management, leaving all rendering and styling to you. This makes it highly customizable and a natural fit for Tailwind CSS and custom UI requirements.

**Key Features:**
- **Headless design:** Complete control over markup and styling, ideal for Tailwind CSS[1][2].
- **Sorting, filtering, global search, pagination:** All core features are supported out of the box via hooks.
- **Column grouping, aggregation, and virtualization:** Advanced features for large datasets.
- **TypeScript support:** First-class, with generics for strong typing.
- **Integration with TanStack Query:** Seamless, as both are from the same ecosystem. Data fetching, pagination, and server-side filtering can be tightly coupled.
- **SSR/Next.js compatibility:** No issues; works well with both client and server components.

**Example Integration:**
```tsx
import { useReactTable, getCoreRowModel } from '@tanstack/react-table';
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const { data } = useQuery(['athletes'], fetchAthletes);

const table = useReactTable({
  data: data ?? [],
  columns,
  getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
  // ...other features like sorting, filtering, pagination
});
```

**Pros:**
- Maximum flexibility for custom UIs.
- Best-in-class TypeScript support.
- Designed for integration with TanStack Query.
- No imposed styles; perfect for Tailwind CSS.

**Cons:**
- Requires more boilerplate for UI (no built-in table components).
- All features (search, filter, pagination) must be wired up, though the logic is provided.

---

### 2. **AG Grid**

**Overview:**  
AG Grid is a **feature-rich, enterprise-grade** table library with a comprehensive set of built-in features and a robust React wrapper.

**Key Features:**
- **Sorting, filtering, global search, pagination:** All built-in and highly configurable.
- **Virtualization:** Handles massive datasets efficiently.
- **Column resizing, grouping, aggregation, tree data, pivoting:** Advanced features for complex data.
- **TypeScript support:** Excellent, with full typings.
- **SSR/Next.js compatibility:** Works, but some features are client-only.
- **Styling:** Customizable, but not headless; comes with its own themes (can be overridden with Tailwind, but requires effort).

**Integration with TanStack Query:**
- Data can be fetched with TanStack Query and passed to AG Grid.
- AG Grid supports both client-side and server-side modes for sorting/filtering/pagination, making it possible to delegate these to your API and TanStack Query.

**Pros:**
- All features are ready out-of-the-box.
- Minimal setup for common table needs.
- Excellent performance for large datasets.

**Cons:**
- Heavier bundle size.
- Less flexible for custom UI compared to headless libraries.
- Some advanced features require a commercial license.

### 3. **RSuite Table**

**Overview:**  
RSuite Table is a component-based table library with built-in features like virtualization, fixed columns, tree views, and more[3][4].

**Key Features:**
- **Sorting, filtering, pagination:** Supported.
- **Virtualization:** Efficient rendering for large datasets.
- **Tree views, expandable rows, RTL support:** Useful for complex data structures.
- **TypeScript support:** Good, but not as comprehensive as TanStack Table or AG Grid.
- **Styling:** Comes with its own styles; customization with Tailwind is possible but can be challenging due to default styling rules[3][4].

**Integration with TanStack Query:**
- Data can be fetched with TanStack Query and passed to RSuite Table.
- Server-side pagination/filtering can be implemented, but requires manual wiring.

**Pros:**
- Many advanced features built-in.
- Good for enterprise/data-heavy UIs.

**Cons:**
- Smaller community.
- Customization can be complex.
- Not headless; less flexible for custom design.

### 4. **Material-UI Table / Ant Design Table / React-Bootstrap-Table**

**Overview:**  
These libraries provide table components as part of larger UI frameworks. They offer built-in features like sorting, filtering, and pagination, but are tightly coupled to their respective design systems[2][4].

**Key Features:**
- **Sorting, filtering, pagination:** Built-in.
- **TypeScript support:** Good.
- **Styling:** Tied to their design system; using with Tailwind CSS requires extra work.

**Integration with TanStack Query:**
- Data can be fetched with TanStack Query and passed to the table.
- Server-side features require manual integration.

**Pros:**
- Quick setup for standard UIs.
- Good documentation and community support.

**Cons:**
- Not headless; limited flexibility for custom UIs.
- Styling conflicts with Tailwind CSS.

A performant, customizable grid with built-in features and strong TypeScript support. More opinionated than TanStack Table, but less so than AG Grid.

**Key Features:**
- **Sorting, filtering, pagination:** Supported.
- **Virtualization:** Yes.
- **TypeScript support:** Good.
- **Styling:** Customizable, but not headless.

**Integration with TanStack Query:**
- Data can be passed from TanStack Query.
- Server-side features require manual setup.

## Recommendations for Your Project

Given your stack (**Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query v5**) and requirements (**sorting, filtering, global search, pagination, strong TypeScript support, custom UI**):

- **TanStack Table** is the best fit if you want maximum flexibility, seamless integration with TanStack Query, and full control over UI and styling. It will require more initial setup, but you can build exactly the table you want, styled with Tailwind, and tightly coupled to your API and TanStack Query hooks[1][2].
- **AG Grid** is the best choice if you want a plug-and-play solution with all features built-in and are willing to accept a heavier bundle and less flexibility in UI. Itâ€™s ideal for data-heavy admin panels or enterprise apps.
- **RSuite Table** is a good middle ground if you need features like tree views or expandable rows, but be prepared for more work customizing the look and feel[3][4].
- **Material-UI/Ant Design/Bootstrap Tables** are not recommended unless your project already uses those UI frameworks, as they conflict with Tailwind and offer less flexibility.

---

## Example: TanStack Table + TanStack Query + Tailwind

```tsx
import { useReactTable, getCoreRowModel, getSortedRowModel, getFilteredRowModel } from '@tanstack/react-table';
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const { data, isLoading } = useQuery(['athletes'], fetchAthletes);

const table = useReactTable({
  data: data ?? [],
  columns,
  getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
  getSortedRowModel: getSortedRowModel(),
  getFilteredRowModel: getFilteredRowModel(),
  // Add pagination, global filter, etc.
});

// Render with Tailwind classes
return (
  <table className="min-w-full divide-y divide-gray-200">
    <thead>
      {/* Render headers with sorting/filtering controls */}
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      {/* Render rows */}
    </tbody>
  </table>
);
```

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **SSR/Next.js:** All libraries above work with Next.js, but headless libraries (TanStack Table) are easiest to use with both client and server components.
- **Large Datasets:** Use virtualization (TanStack Table, AG Grid, RSuite Table) to avoid performance issues.
- **Custom Filtering/Searching:** With TanStack Table, you implement your own UI and logic, but the hooks make it straightforward.
- **TypeScript:** TanStack Table and AG Grid have the strongest TypeScript support; always use generics for row data.
- **Accessibility:** You must implement ARIA roles and keyboard navigation yourself with headless libraries.

---

## Actionable Guidance

- For **Task 5 (Roster Handling and Import)**, use TanStack Table to display imported athlete data, leveraging TanStack Query for data fetching and mutations. Implement sorting, filtering, and search using TanStack Table hooks, and style with Tailwind CSS.
- For **Task 4 (Event Management CRUD)**, reuse the same table setup for event lists, ensuring consistency and reusability.
- For **Task 18 (Performance Optimization)**, enable virtualization in TanStack Table for large datasets, and offload filtering/pagination to the server via TanStack Query.

**Summary:**  
**TanStack Table** is the most future-proof, flexible, and stack-aligned choice for your project. AG Grid is a strong alternative for enterprise features, but at the cost of flexibility and bundle size. Avoid UI-framework-specific tables unless you are already committed to their ecosystems.
