# Task ID: 20
# Title: Polish UI for Consistency and Enhanced User Experience
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Refine and unify the user interface across all components, ensuring consistent styling, improved visual elements, and a seamless user experience for dropdowns, cards, forms, navigation, and weapon icons.
# Details:
1. Audit all existing UI components (dropdowns, cards, forms, navigation, weapon icons) for inconsistencies in styling, spacing, and visual hierarchy.
2. Establish or refine a design system, including a color palette, typography, spacing, and component variants, referencing modern UI libraries (e.g., MUI) for best practices and accessibility standards[2][4].
3. Refactor components to use functional patterns and modular CSS-in-JS or utility-first CSS frameworks for maintainability and scalability[1][3].
4. Enhance visual elements by updating icons (including weapon icons), adding subtle animations or transitions, and improving responsiveness for all screen sizes.
5. Ensure all components are accessible, supporting keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and screen reader compatibility[2].
6. Integrate improved error and loading states for forms and interactive elements, following modern UX guidelines.
7. Collaborate with stakeholders to review and iterate on UI changes, gathering feedback for further refinement.
8. Document the updated design system and component usage guidelines for future development.

# Test Strategy:
- Manually review all UI components for visual consistency, alignment, and adherence to the design system across different browsers and devices.
- Use automated accessibility testing tools (e.g., axe, Lighthouse) to verify ARIA support, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.
- Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on usability and visual appeal.
- Validate responsiveness and layout integrity on various screen sizes.
- Ensure all interactive elements provide clear feedback and error handling.
- Review code for maintainability, modularity, and adherence to functional component best practices.
