# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Real-time Updates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add real-time update functionality for live results and brackets using WebSockets.
# Details:
1. Set up Socket.IO for WebSocket communication.
2. Implement real-time update logic for scores, rankings, and brackets.
3. Create fallback polling mechanism for environments where WebSockets are not available.
4. Optimize for performance with large numbers of concurrent users.
5. Implement reconnection logic for handling temporary disconnections.
6. Ensure real-time updates work across different user roles and permissions.

# Test Strategy:
Test real-time updates with multiple concurrent users. Verify fallback to polling when WebSockets are unavailable. Stress test with high numbers of simultaneous connections.
