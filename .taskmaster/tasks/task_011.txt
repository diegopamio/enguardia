# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement PDF Report Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop functionality to generate PDF reports for poule sheets, match slips, brackets, and final rankings.
# Details:
1. Use a library like react-pdf or jsPDF for PDF generation.
2. Create templates for each report type (poule sheets, match slips, brackets, rankings).
3. Implement API routes for triggering report generation.
4. Design UI for requesting and downloading reports.
5. Ensure generated PDFs match Engarde layouts.
6. Implement caching mechanism to avoid regenerating unchanged reports.

# Test Strategy:
Verify PDF generation for all report types. Compare generated PDFs with Engarde outputs for layout consistency. Test PDF generation with large datasets.
