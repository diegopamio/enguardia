<info added on 2025-06-25T04:16:52.862Z>
API Routes Implementation Summary:

Multilingual Event Data Model has been successfully created with full support for multiple languages using the existing translation tables.

API Routes Implemented:
- `/api/events` - GET (list events) and POST (create events) 
- `/api/events/[id]` - GET (single event), PUT (update), DELETE (delete)

Features Implemented:
- Complete CRUD operations with Zod schema validation
- Multilingual support with automatic locale detection from Accept-Language headers
- Integration with OrganizationTranslation and EventTranslation tables
- Authentication and authorization using existing middleware
- Default locale fallback when translations unavailable
- Transaction-based operations for data consistency
- Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

Security & Validation:
- Role-based access control (PUBLIC for read, ORGANIZATION_ADMIN for create/update/delete)
- Server-side validation for all input data (dates, enums, multilingual content)
- Detailed error responses with validation information

Database Integration:
- Utilized Prisma schema with Event, EventTranslation, and Organization models
- Implemented proper foreign key relationships and cascade operations
- Added transaction support for atomic operations

The API now supports all required fields (weapon, category, dates, venue, participants, translations) and is ready for frontend integration.

## 2. Implement Server-Side Validation and Authentication [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Add robust server-side validation for event data and enforce authentication and authorization using the existing authentication system.
### Details:
Ensure all event data submitted via API routes is validated for required fields, correct formats, and multilingual consistency. Integrate authentication middleware to restrict access to authorized users only.
<info added on 2025-06-25T04:35:48.768Z>
Successfully completed enhanced server-side validation and authentication:

✅ **Comprehensive Validation Library**: Created `/src/lib/validation.ts` with:
- Enhanced Zod schemas for event creation, updates, and queries
- Custom validation functions for business logic (date ranges, status transitions, participant limits)
- Proper error formatting with detailed field-level error messages
- Type-safe input/output interfaces

✅ **Advanced Authorization Checks**: Implemented granular permission system:
- Role-based access control (SYSTEM_ADMIN, ORGANIZATION_ADMIN, etc.)
- Organization-specific resource access validation
- Event status transition validation (prevents invalid state changes)
- Business logic protection (can't delete events with registrations)

✅ **Enhanced API Security**: Updated all event API routes with:
- Query parameter validation with pagination limits (1-100 items)
- Request body validation with comprehensive field validation
- Session context passing for authorization checks
- Proper HTTP status codes (400 for validation, 403 for authorization, 404 for not found)

✅ **Business Logic Protection**: Added safeguards for:
- Date range validation (end date after start date, events can't start more than 1 day in past)
- Status transition validation (DRAFT → REGISTRATION_OPEN → REGISTRATION_CLOSED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED)
- Registration deadline validation (must be before event start)
- Participant limit validation (2-1000 participants)
- Event deletion protection (can't delete events with registrations or in certain statuses)

✅ **Testing Verified**: API endpoints properly return:
- 401 for unauthenticated requests
- 400 for validation errors with detailed field information
- 403 for authorization failures
- Proper error message formatting

The server-side validation and authentication system is now production-ready with comprehensive security, validation, and business logic protection.

## Critical Issue Found: Event Model No Longer Exists 🚨

### Root Cause Analysis:
During our architectural redesign to Tournament > Competition > Phase structure, the Event model was removed from the schema, but the `/api/events` endpoints and Events page still try to access `prisma.event.findMany()`, causing system-wide failures in the event management functionality.

### Impact Assessment:
- **API Layer**: `/api/events` endpoints returning 500 errors due to missing Prisma model
- **UI Layer**: Events page showing error states when attempting to fetch/create/update events
- **Error Handling**: Our new error system correctly captures the errors but can't resolve the underlying architectural issue

### Comprehensive Solution Plan:
1. **API Migration**:
   - Deprecate `/api/events/*` endpoints with proper warning responses
   - Ensure `/api/tournaments/*` endpoints provide equivalent functionality
   - Add mapping layer for backward compatibility if needed

2. **UI Component Updates**:
   - Rename EventManagement → TournamentManagement
   - Update all imports and component references
   - Modify form fields to match Tournament schema
   - Update validation rules for Tournament model

3. **Navigation & UX Updates**:
   - Change "Events" to "Tournaments" in navigation menu
   - Update breadcrumbs and page titles
   - Modify success/error messages to reference tournaments

4. **Error Handling Adjustments**:
   - Update error message catalog to use tournament terminology
   - Add migration-specific error messages for clarity
   - Ensure proper error handling for transition period

### Implementation Priority:
1. Fix critical API endpoints first to restore basic functionality
2. Update UI components to use new endpoints
3. Rename components and update navigation
4. Test full CRUD workflow with Tournament system
5. Update documentation and user guides

### Estimated Effort: Medium (1-2 days)
This requires coordinated changes across API, UI, and error handling layers, but follows a straightforward migration pattern.
